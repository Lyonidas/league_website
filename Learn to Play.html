        <h1>How to Play League of Legends</h1>
        <h2>Step 1: Creating a Account</h2>
        <img src="Images/Ashe_0.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>The first thing you want to do to play is create a acount. The game is free to play and costs nothing, you dont have to put a dime into the game ever. Click on <a href="https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index">League of Legends</a> to visit site to play. After creating a account you than download the game which is roughly 10 to 20 GB of memory. When the game finishes patching and downloading you than create a summoner name.</p>
        <h2>Step 2 Play Tutorials</h2>
        <img src="Images/srdb3-1.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>You should start by playing a few tutorial games because the game has intense mouse mechanics. These games can be played solo or with 1-4 other friends and you play against bots/AI's. The tutorials are probably the most important because during this time you learn the very basics of the game.</p>
        <h2>Step 3 How to CS or Creep Score</h2>
        <img src="Images/Screen35.png" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Creep score is the fundamental most important mechanic in the game. Creep score is how many minions you can last hit per game. Minions/Creeps are the little soldiers that fight each other before crashing into a enemy tower trying to destroy the tower. Learning to last hit the creeps with a auto attack before they die to your minions or tower will generate gold for you. When you generate gold you can than go back to base and purchase items. Purchasing items will make you stronger to fight your opponents and ultimatley win the game. All of this comes down to learning how to last hit minions.</p>
        <h2>Step 4 Generating Gold</h2>
        <img src="Images/lVHcSo2.png" align="middle" height="700" width="500">
        <p>Last hitting creeps isnt the only way to generate gold. You can fight and defeat champions to gain gold. You can crash minion waves into enemy towers and than destroy the tower to generate 1000 gold for your entire team. Defeating champions with high bounties will also generate gold for you. and last but not least helping champions get kills and towers also generate gold. This gold can now be spent on items to make you stronger to defeat enemy champions and help your teamtes in team fighting. Each champion has different item builds that make them strong. Finally each role has specific item build paths to follow to make you useful in team fights.</p>
        <h2>Step 5 Level Your Account</h2>
        <img src="Images/tumblr_nea4i9gpfB1qgrdiqo2_1280.png" align="middle" height="500" width="600">
        <p>The final step to learning league is to level your account. The only way to level your account is to play the game. When you play the game you get better at the game. Once you get your account to level 30 you can than play ranked and when you play ranked you get placed in a ranked tier we talked about on the home page. This game takes alot of practice and team work. However it is extremely fun to play with your friends. So good luck climbing the tier ladder and I might just see you on the rift summoner.</p>
