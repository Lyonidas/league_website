        <h1>Learn to play a Role/Champion</h1>
        <img src="Images/346346346346.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>League of Legends has 5 roles and over 140 champions. After doing the math thats about 30 to 40 champions per role. The best way to climb in ranked is to stick to one role and 2 to 3 of your favorite champions in those roles. This way you learn all the enemy match ups and your power spikes. When you hone down on one champion it really helps you improve your mechanics on that champion. When you feel comfortable playing one champion you can than focus on other aspects of the game like roaming and trading with your opponents in lane. We will now go over the 5 different roles in depth you can play in this game.</p>
        <h2>Top Lane</h2>
        <img src="Images/Darius_OriginalSkin.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Top lane is at the farthest top point of the summoners rift map. If you like isolation during games this role might be good for you. You are 1v1ing and farming cs the majority of the game. In a game where you are playing with friends as a team it is good to play a more tanky champion to protect your damage dealers adc/mid laner. However when you are playing solo queue you might want to try to carry yourself to the top. In this case you might want to play a more bruiser/carry. Heres the list of top laners: Gangplank, Fiora, Cho'Gath, Singed, Riven, Jarvin IV, Yasuo, Daruis, Jayce, Galio, Urgot, Vladimir, Irelia, Tryndamere, Ornn, Maokai, Gnar, Renekton, Pantheon, Kayle, Akali, Teemo, Garen, Jax, Kled, Nasus, Wukong, Kennen, Sion, Rumble, Trundle, Camille, Malphite, Illaoi, and Shen.</p>
        <h2>Jungle</h2>
        <img src="Images/LeeSin_Splash_0.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Jungle is different than the other 4 roles because this role you play in your teams side of the jungle. The jungle consists of different monsters you have to fight to gain gold. After gaining enough gold you can than buy smaller items and than you surprise attack a enemy laner. This is called ganking another lane. When you gank another lane you pressure the map by ganging up on 1 other person. So say your top laner is 1v1ing the enemy top lane you than gank/surprise attack the enemy top laner forcing him into a 2v1 situation. This makes jungling extremely important because jungling requires alot of objective control and helping your laners. Here's a list of Junglers: Cho'gath, Jarvan IV, Sejuani, Shyvana, Ezreal, Nidalee, Kha'zix, Kayn, Evelynn, Kayn, Udyr, Jax, Xin Zhao, Rammas, Warwick, Rengar, Rek'Sai, Hecarim, Vi, Elise, Shaco, Nocturne, Ekko, Lee Sin, Fiddlesticks, Amumu, Maokai, Mastery Yi, Zac, Graves, and Gragas.</p>
        <h2>Middle Lane</h2>
        <img src="Images/arcadeahrifinal.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>This lane is in the middle of the map and the most mechanically intense lane to play in the game. This is because it has the widest variety of champions to play. These champions you can play in this lane consist of mages, assassins, adc's, and some tanks. It also takes alot of mechanical skill because you have the lowest auto attack damage in the game as a mage. This is because most mid lane mages dont rely on attak damage but instead they rely on magic damage. This role is also considered another jungler because they have to roam and help the team in the early stages of the game as well. List of Mid Laner's: Xerath, Galio, Zed, Malzahar, Talon, Veigar, Katarina, Orianna, Twisted Fate, Anivia, Ziggs, Fizz, Vel'Koz, Kassadin, Ahri, Azir, Annie, Ekko, Vladimir, Jayce, Lux, Yasuo, Corki, Syndra, Diana, Lissandra, LeBlanc, Brand, Taliyah, Cassiopeia, Viktor, Lucian, and Ryze.</p>
        <h2>Attack Damage Carry</h2>
        <img src="Images/619addad3975d2a8487be08bb9a3d025.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Attack Damage carrys along with their supports can be found in the bottom lane of the map. This is the most important role during the late stages of the game. The adc does huge amounts of damage the later the game goes on. This is because Attack Damage scales the most in the game compared to the other roles. So during the early parts of the game the adc usually needs to just farm and get creep score while letting the team make plays. The adc is the weakest champion in the early parts of the game and they require a support in there lane. List of ADCs to play: Twitch, Tristana, Xayah, Miss Fortune, Draven, Jinx, Vayne, Kog'Maw, Jhin, Ezreal, Ashe, Caitlyn, Kalista, Sivir, Varus, and Lucian.</p>
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <img src="Images/V3ydi.jpg" align="middle" height="300" width="500">
        <p>Support is unique because they protect the adc during the laning phase of the game. The adc is extremely weak during the laning phase of the game. The support provides healing, sheilding, vision, engage, disengage, and other things for the adc. The best way to carry as a support is to keep the adc alive and help the team by warding and keeping vision of the fog of war on the map. Providing vision for your teamates keeps them safe from enemys and gives them knowledge over objectives. Support List: Soraka, Janna, Lulu, Sona, Taric, Blitzcrank, Zilean, Nami, Bard, Thresh, Leona, Alistar, Brand, Vel'Koz, Zyra, Morgana, Rakan, Braum, Tahm Kench, and Karma.</p>
